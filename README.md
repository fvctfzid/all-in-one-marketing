![ActiveCampaign Screenshot](image/activecampaign.webp)

Wishpond also plays well with other tools – if you already use Mailchimp or ActiveCampaign for emails, Wishpond can integrate with those, so you can use its landing page/contest tools in conjunction with your existing email service. This platform is especially useful for **marketing agencies or small businesses** that run a lot of promotions, as it supports multiple client accounts and provides an agency dashboard in higher plans.

If you are a **knowledge entrepreneur** who wants to focus on content and marketing rather than tech, Kajabi provides a reliable, professional-grade hub to do it all – from website to course delivery to email funnels.

## [Ontraport](https://ontraport.com) – CRM + Marketing Automation Suite for Growing Businesses

## [Keap](https://keap.com) (Infusionsoft) – Complete CRM & Marketing Automation for Small Biz

*Small-business CRM known for its powerful automation, sales pipelines, and integrated email marketing.*

![Keap Screenshot](image/keap.webp)


**Keap** – formerly Infusionsoft – is a long-standing **all-in-one CRM and marketing automation platform** aimed at small businesses. It offers a blend of **contact management**, **email & SMS marketing**, **sales pipeline** management, and **e-commerce** capabilities in one system. Keap helps entrepreneurs capture new leads (via custom forms or landing pages), then automatically follow up and nurture those leads using its campaign builder. You can create sophisticated **automation workflows** that send emails or texts, apply tags, create tasks for your team, and more based on triggers (like a form filled, an appointment scheduled, or a purchase made). All plans include core features like **CRM, email marketing, appointments, quotes, and analytics**, while higher tiers add more advanced automation and customization. One of Keap’s strengths is the **visual pipeline** for sales – you can track leads and deals through stages, which is great for service businesses that need to manage consultations or proposals. It also has a **built-in payment system**, so you can send invoices or take payments online, and the system will log everything to the contact record. For marketing, Keap’s **email builder** and templates are straightforward to use, and you can segment contacts easily for targeted campaigns. The **learning curve** has improved over the years (Infusionsoft was infamous for complexity, but Keap’s newer interface is more user-friendly). Do note that Keap is relatively **premium-priced** (starting around $129/month for the basic tier and going up with more contacts), and it’s best for those who intend to use both the CRM and automation heavily – if you only need simple email newsletters, it might be overkill. In summary, Keap is ideal for **small businesses that require both a CRM and robust marketing automation in one** – for example, a coaching practice or an agency that needs to track clients and automate follow-ups in a single system, rather than using separate apps.

## [Groove.cm](https://groove.cm) (GrooveFunnels) – Suite of Online Business Tools with Lifetime Option

*Ambitious all-in-one platform including funnel builder, email marketing, e-commerce, and more (some features still evolving).*

![Groove.cm Screenshot](image/groove.webp)


**Groove** (also known as GrooveFunnels or Groove.cm) is a suite of online marketing tools designed to help businesses manage various aspects of their online presence – including **website building, sales funnels, email marketing, and even webinars and e-commerce**. It launched in 2020 as a high-promise platform bundling many functions under one roof. The core of Groove is **GroovePages**, a funnel and website builder with a drag-and-drop editor to create landing pages, sales funnels, and full websites. For email marketing, there’s **GrooveMail**, which lets you set up campaigns and automated sequences much like dedicated email tools. Groove also includes **GrooveSell** and **GrooveKart** for selling products – covering digital sales and even full storefronts for print-on-demand or physical products. Unique offerings in Groove’s suite are **GrooveWebinars** (for live and automated webinars) and **GrooveVideo** (a video hosting service with marketing-oriented features). They even have **GrooveAffiliate** to manage your own affiliate programs if you want to recruit affiliates for your products. The appeal of Groove is having all these interconnected tools without monthly subscriptions – they famously offered a **Lifetime deal** for early adopters. In terms of user experience, Groove has a modern interface and plenty of features, but some users note that certain features have been slow to mature or that there’s a learning curve as the ecosystem is so broad. However, continuous updates are being made. For marketers who want a **one-login solution** covering everything (and who are willing to be patient with a few growing pains), Groove provides tremendous value – especially if you secured the lifetime access. It’s particularly interesting for those who utilize **webinars and video marketing** as part of their funnels, since those tools are built-in. If fully realized, Groove aims to replace a dozen separate subscriptions (page builder, email service, cart, etc.), making it a potential game-changer for digital entrepreneurs seeking an all-encompassing platform.

## [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) – Popular Email Marketing Platform with All-in-One Features

*Email marketing leader that now offers a broader marketing platform (landing pages, e-commerce, and more).*

![Mailchimp Screenshot](image/mailchimp.webp)


**Mailchimp** is often the first name that comes to mind for email newsletters, but it brands itself as an **“All-in-One Marketing Platform”**, aiming to consolidate various marketing functions for small businesses. With Mailchimp, you of course get a reliable **email marketing service** – easy drag-and-drop email designer, audience segmentation, and scheduling – but in recent years they have added many tools: a **landing page builder**, basic **website builder**, and even an e-commerce storefront option for selling products (with integrations to payment gateways). This means a small business could theoretically host a simple website or landing pages and run email campaigns all from Mailchimp. They also offer **social media posting and ad management** from the dashboard, allowing you to create Facebook or Instagram ads and track results. Additionally, Mailchimp has built-in **CRM-like features**, where you can manage contacts, tag them with attributes, and view a combined contact profile with their interactions. While Mailchimp’s automation is not as advanced as some dedicated platforms, you can still set up **customer journeys** (multi-step drip campaigns based on triggers like signups or purchases) to nurture leads. One standout is Mailchimp’s generous **Free plan**, which has long been popular – it allows smaller senders to use core email features at no cost (until your list grows beyond a certain point). This makes Mailchimp an attractive starting point for new businesses. The trade-off is that Mailchimp can be a bit **limited or inflexible** in advanced automation, and pricing can jump once you move to paid tiers or have a large list. Overall, for a **small business or creator just starting out**, Mailchimp offers an approachable all-in-one marketing toolkit – you can get a website online, start capturing emails, and send campaigns without needing a bunch of separate services. As your needs grow, you might outgrow it, but Mailchimp remains a solid launchpad with one of the friendliest user experiences in the industry.

## [Constant Contact](https://constantcontact.com) – Digital Marketing Suite for Small Businesses

*Small-business marketing platform combining email, social, and website building with an emphasis on ease of use.*

Its goal is to make online marketing easy for beginners. With Constant Contact, you get a dependable **email marketing tool** (with hundreds of templates, a drag-and-drop editor, and support for features like surveys and event invitations), plus additional goodies like a **social media scheduler** and even an **SMS marketing** add-on. Notably, Constant Contact includes a **website builder** in its toolkit – a simple AI-powered site builder that can create a basic website or landing pages for you, which is great for small businesses without a site. It also has **e-commerce capabilities**: you can set up an online store, manage a product catalog, and send abandoned cart emails if you connect it with their e-commerce integrations. For capturing new leads, Constant Contact provides forms and even text-to-join options. One niche feature is the ability to promote and manage events (including collecting RSVPs or selling event tickets through their platform), which is handy for nonprofits or event organizers. In terms of **marketing automation**, Constant Contact is on the simpler side – you can schedule automated welcome emails or birthday emails, etc., but it’s not a full-blown workflow builder like some others. The appeal here is really the **approachability**: Constant Contact offers a lot of guidance, live support, and pre-made marketing plans to help small business owners who may not be tech-savvy. It’s a **paid platform with tiered pricing** based mainly on list size (no free plan beyond a short trial). If you are a **local business, nonprofit, or sole proprietor** looking for a one-stop marketing solution (website + email + some social) that’s straightforward to use, Constant Contact fits that profile well – it covers the marketing essentials without overwhelming you with complexity.

One handy aspect is the **brand studio/dashboard** which gives a bird’s-eye view of all campaigns and their performance, ensuring that your messaging is consistent. Zoho Marketing Plus also ties into **Zoho CRM** seamlessly – marketers can see CRM data and segment or trigger actions based on sales info, and sales teams see marketing touchpoints. For content creation, you have a document hub for collaborating on collateral. If you run events, Zoho Marketing Plus can integrate Zoho Backstage (for event management), so your webinars or conferences become part of your marketing mix in the same system. The platform offers **analytics and ROI tracking**, so you can attribute leads and revenue to various campaigns easily. Since it’s part of the Zoho family, it’s particularly attractive for those already using Zoho’s other software (like Zoho CRM or Zoho Commerce), as it completes the all-in-one experience. However, even on its own, Marketing Plus is a cost-effective solution (Zoho is known for reasonable pricing) for mid-sized businesses that want a **centralized marketing command center**. It might not have specialized funnel builders like some competitors, but as a **broad marketing suite**, especially if you value integration with CRM and other business tools, Zoho Marketing Plus is a strong contender that continues to grow in capabilities.

## [HighLevel](https://gohighlevel.com) – All-in-One Platform for Agencies (White-Label Ready)

HighLevel’s philosophy is to replace the patchwork of software an agency might use for clients (email automation, text message tools, booking calendars, etc.) with one unified app. For example, a local business client could have their **website landing pages**, their **Google/Facebook ad lead forms**, and their **follow-up campaigns** (text messages and emails) all running through a HighLevel account managed by the agency. It also includes **reputation management** – pulling in Google and Facebook reviews and allowing you to request reviews – which is great for local businesses. A standout feature of HighLevel is the ability to **white-label** it: agencies can brand the platform as their own and even resell accounts to clients. They also provide a membership area feature for hosting courses or content, and integrations to popular tools and social platforms for posting. HighLevel’s **automation builder** is very powerful – you can visually create workflows that handle multi-channel communication and lead routing (e.g., when a new lead comes in, automatically send a text, then an email, create a CRM deal, alert a team member, etc.). Because it’s so feature-rich, HighLevel can feel complex initially, but it’s incredibly flexible. Pricing is also unique – it’s a flat monthly fee for the agency (unlimited sub-accounts), which can be highly cost-effective if you manage multiple projects.

With Thrive’s tools, you can design high-converting pages and funnels on your own domain, run email signup forms with detailed targeting and triggers, and create quizzes or surveys to engage users. It’s important to note that Thrive Suite does **not include an email service or CRM** – rather, it focuses on the on-site conversion elements and integrates with your email marketing service of choice via API. For example, you’d capture leads with Thrive Leads and send them into Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, etc., for follow-up. Thrive Suite is sold as a **subscription (around $30-$90/month depending on billing cycle) for all plugins on up to 25 sites**, which is quite economical given the range of tools. The **conversion-focused approach** is what shines – every feature is about boosting signups, sales, and engagement on your site. If you are comfortable with WordPress and want an **all-in-one marketing toolkit that lives on your website** (with no limitations on leads or pages since it’s self-hosted), Thrive Suite is an excellent solution. It’s especially popular among bloggers, course creators, and small businesses who want **full ownership of their funnel infrastructure** without sacrificing functionality.
